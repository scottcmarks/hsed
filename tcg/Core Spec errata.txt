5.1.1 b. uinteger. Unsigned integer. To differentiate among the type sizes, a size identifier is specified with the type, i.e. a one-byte integer is denoted as uinteger_1, etc.
"one-byte integer" should be "one-byte unsigned integer" to make a clear distinction from the otherwise identical languague in "a. integer. Signed integer."

"Type = Base_Type / Simple_Type / Enumeration_Type / Alternative_Type / List_Type /
 Restricted_Reference_Type / General_Reference_Type / Named_Value_Type /
 Struct_Type / Set_Type" does not match the subsequent list, including no
mention of General_Reference_Table_Type

Named_Value_Name_Type = 11 1*32bytes bytes_8
Name_Value_Integer_Type = 12 integer_2 bytes_8
Name_Value_Uinteger_Type = 13 uinteger_2 bytes_8

Why is the first one "Named_Value_..." and the next two "Name_Value_..."
The latter two are later refered to as Named_Value_...

Not an error, exactly, and probably immutable at this point, but ..
Simple_Type has the pattern <uid,size>, whereas all the other two-parameter
types are <size,(uid|[uid])>.  Messes with the rhythm.


"c. Enumeration_Type. This is a n unsigned integer in a specific range." should be
"c. Enumeration_Type. This is an unsigned integer in a specific range."

5.1.3.13ff Table 63 ff
dashes in names should be underscores, e.g. byte-table-ref s/b byte_table_ref
Seems to be more a problem in pdftxt than in the original.


no "Table 71-3/4 bytes_8" or bytes_8 in the Types table.
This is presumably because UID is also bytes_8, and because there happen to be
no types using "raw" bytes_8 instead of uid variants.  Since this is the case,
we should eliminate the term "bytes_8" in favor of "uid" or "uidref" as
appropriate.

Table 72 "Certificates_object _ref" should be "Certificates_object_ref"

Table 75 "Fractoin" should be "Fraction"

Table 101 "Eror" should be "Error"

5.1.3.56 "" should be "4"
